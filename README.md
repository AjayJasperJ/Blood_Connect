# Blood connect: blood donation with notification alert (Live)

Users register with their blood group, health details, and location to build a trusted donor network. The app sends emergency alert notifications to nearby eligible donors. It ensures donor safety by enforcing a strict interval between donations and checking health history. The goal is to make blood donation faster, safer, and more accessible in critical moments.
